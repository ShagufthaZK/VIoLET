# Working with the VIoLET UI

This project comes with an easy to use web based management tool for setting up and monitoring the deployment.

## Steps to start the UI

1. Sudo privilege is needed to start the UI server.
2. Go to the VIoLET project root directory (Not this UI subdirectory!) in the Admin VM and execute the following command in a shell,
    
    ```
    $ sudo sh start_ui.sh
    ```
3. Navigate to the public IP address of the Admin VM in your browser to access the web based management tool.
